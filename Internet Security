Active cyber attacks are often aggressive, blatant attacks that victims immediately become aware of when they occur. 
Active attacks are highly malicious in nature, often locking out users, destroying memory or files, or forcefully gaining access to a targeted system or network. 
Viruses, worms, malware, Denial of Service attacks, and password crackers are all examples of active cyber attacks. 
Usually, hackers that use active attacks are not much concerned with their activities being detected because by 
the time the attack is detected the damage is already done or is underway.


Passive cyber attacks often employ non-disruptive and covert methods so that the hacker does not draw attention to the attack. 
The purpose of the passive attack is to gain access to the computer system or network and to collect data without detection. 
Many data security breaches involving the exposure of credit card and debit card payment information are the result of passive attacks, 
as are data breaches where the targeted data collected during the attack is user name, 
passwords and other personal identifying information.

Passive attacks are usually data gathering operations, which means they usually employ some sort of malware or hack that eavesdrops on system communications 
(i.e., scrubs email for personal identifying information) or records system communications (i.e., keystroke recording malware). 
Information that is gathered in a passive cyber attack is usually sold on the blackmarket and dark web for the financial gain of whoever perpetrated the passive attack.
